# Security Toolkit
## Under Development
A personal, modular security automation toolkit designed for fast usage across different machines and environments.

This repository exists to solve a simple problem:

> When switching to a new PC, VM or lab environment, I want my own scripts ready to use in minutes.

## Goals

- Fast setup on any machine  
- Modular and reusable scripts  
- Optimized for VPN / lab / CTF environments  
- Minimal dependencies  
- Easy chaining between tools

## What This Repo Is

- A personal toolbox, not a monolithic framework  
- A growing collection of small, focused scripts  
- A base for future automation and pipelines
